    <h1>Why I Left Instagram</h1>
    <h2>(this may be TMI, all things considered, but as long as I'm keeping honesty up and needless vulgarity down [with emphasis on 'needless'], AND you keep your opinions to yourself, I trust this work in progress will progress swimmingly!</h2>
    <p>The Answer: On social media's part, I have come to consider all entities
    as subsumed into advertising. There is no distinction between friends,
    family, acquaintences, enemies; they are all advertisements, regardless of
    intent.</p>
    <p>On a personal note, I have come to grow suspicious of all empathetic
    arguments. Similarly to an apology that promises lip-service, not action, so
    to0 does an appeal to empathy. Old trolls and recent argumentors share the
    same bed; they speak of care yet rely on the emotional rigor of others.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What must be understood is that this view can be held without spite,
    without anger, without expectation. This space requires self-awareness and
    rigor to achieve; to fail this task is a common pitfall (which leads to
    shoddy argumentation) and a public out. This 'out' is an opportunity to
    gaslight: to express discontent or to imply that there's more to the story
    is to invoke selfishness and conspiracy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What's that old mantra, anyway? About 'telling your own story' in spite
    of all others who readily take the charge upon themselves? Parents and
    friends, for instance; they are more opt for this kind of work, as if it were a kindness to
    bestow instead of an injustice masquarading under an empathic motive. After all, what's the
    harm of an embellishment, a fond memory crafted from an outside, sympathetic source? Who
    would choose to be forgotten?</p>
    <p>I illicit 'empathy' and 'sympathy' on purpose (nevermind the fact that
    this repetion comes off a bit plain, a bit lazy in the writing department),
    for these are sentiments shared by family, acquaintences, indifferent
    entities and enemies alike. It's a range of attitudes held as 'true'. While
    an enemy and an aquintence may have ulterior motives, the word is taken for
    granted as 'real'. You may lie, you may taint the verbs in some way, but to
    express 'sympathy/empathy' is pure, is desired, and is constantly
    'achieved'.</p>
    <p>Quotes galor! Already I am tired and wish to merely express my privately
    held truth: empathy (I will reduce this dynamic to one word) is too easily
    expressed, pursued, or argued. It does not do what you intend. It's the
    prep before combustion occurs; it is a priming of sorts that doesn't need
    any public change or, most importantly, private work.</p>
    <p>Which brings me to Instagram. Distinctions are ironed out to the extreme, to the point where family and enemies might as well share the same profile and where these two both find company with products, brands, and iniciatives. They advertise together.</p>
