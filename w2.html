    <h2>On Dead Artists</h2>
    <p>It's important to respect your elders moreso than your contemporaries.
    The latter are on the same train with you through life and, good nature
    aside, would happily fight for a better view, an empty aisle, or a more
    convenient passage to the food cart or the exit.</p>
    <p>The former, stiff as they might be, are infinitely more agreeable. First
    of which being this: they are dead! Never will we need to fear a backstab, a
    neglect, an indifference from a ghoul. To expect this, a polarized intention
    to a spectral presence, would be to truly live as a masterbatory simp.
    Ghosts and shadows may be nefarious, but a haunting doesn't imply a
    betrayal, which is all too human.</p>
    <p>The fact that some of these artists and their work 'haunt' is precisely
    why we should look, too. Two is a matter of staying power, of proving one's
    contribution well past their expiration date. It may be a nook, a cranny, a
    crevice to what is undoubtably dumb, esoteric, or rediculous, but it is a
    dialogue between artist and their medium, turned to a conversation among
    museum staff and the general public.</p>
    <p>Third follows thusly: to look to an old collection and see the work in
    person is to see a point in time, a convergence of material, sentiment, and
    rigor that comes together into a genuine artistic article. Even a
    promotional venture (such as a print ad) can be saved via the passage of
    time, when the artist dies and the business fails, and what we glean is
    beyond the efficacy of a particular snake-oil product (which is par the
    course in contemporary culture). We see an artist (or put more humbly, a
    'human') at work, making something just as fettered by mental games and
    existential anxieties yet destilled of all these through the once-run
    purification of death. Purified, yet owing itself to inconsistency, lacking
    anticipation of this or that, and a socio-material narrowness of being.</p>
    <p>Universality is touted as a nut to be cracked among my peers, as if the
    portal demands constant labor in order to achieve; it's a construct where
    the personal brick and mortar are a means, where individual experience will
    'progress' to a state that is actually worth accounting for. There is no
    evidence for this; a collection points to views accounted for AND to those
    that are missing, which is precisely why they are valuable. We accrue the
    personal so that, even after death, that firm threshold can be peirced
    time-and-time again by the next of kin. Our inheritence is in our elders,
    not our peers, in the consequences of time that permit madness and specificity.</p>
